# MLOps - What to do when you have a machine learning model

This is my talk presented at [ML4all](http://ml4all.org/) on 4/30/2019 in Portland, Oregon.

This repository contains the Markdown slides, as well as the example model and the example inference code for REST and gRPC APIs.

The example model was based on a demo project by [Sara Robinson from GCP](https://medium.com/tensorflow/building-a-text-classification-model-with-tensorflow-hub-and-estimators-3169e7aa568).
